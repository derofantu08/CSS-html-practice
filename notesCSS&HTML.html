    <h2>Grids on CSS</h2>
    In CSS, Grid Layout (CSS Grid) is a powerful layout system that allows you to create complex, two-dimensional 
    layouts (rows and columns) easily. It provides a grid-based structure where you can place elements precisely on
     a webpage.<br>

Key Concepts:<br>
Grid Container: The parent element where the grid layout is applied, defined using display: grid.<br>
Grid Items: The child elements inside the grid container, which are placed in rows and columns.<br>
Grid Lines, Tracks, and Areas: These define the structure of the grid, specifying where items are placed
